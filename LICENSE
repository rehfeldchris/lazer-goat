The file lazer-goat.js in this project was originally named asteroids.js, created by erkie at https://github.com/erkie/erkie.github.com

I made some modifications to it to support my needs. I don't place any additional
license restrictions other than what was already set by erkie, although if you use my code, a small
 acknowledgement somewhere would be appreciated.

 I used a goat sound file that I got from http://soundbible.com/619-Goat-Bah.html

The code is in asteroids.js, and if you feel like pushing any updates it would really help if you updated the asteroids.min.js to match your commit.
