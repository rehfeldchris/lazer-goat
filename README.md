#What is it?
Javascript that can be added to any webpage to add a goat that can move and shoot, causing dom elements to explode.
 It's reminiscent of the old game called asteroids.


#Demo
There's a bookmarklet which you can click to add the goat to any webpage.


#Credits
I modified it, but it's heavily based on `asteroids.js` written by  [erkie](https://github.com/erkie).
